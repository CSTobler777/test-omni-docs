# Support Billing

## Our Approach

We always aim to provide clients with maximum value within their hosting plan scope. Look for opportunities to help clients succeed without immediately jumping to billable work.

## When to Open a Support Ticket

Open a support ticket when a client requests work that falls outside their hosting plan coverage. If you're unsure whether something is covered, check with management before committing to billable work.

## Billing Structure

- **Minimum charge:** $150 (covers the first hour of work)
- **Additional hours:** $135 per hour

## Best Practices

- **Communicate upfront:** Before starting billable work, inform the client that a support ticket will be opened and provide an estimated time/cost
- **Track time accurately:** Log all time spent on the ticket for proper billing
- **Document thoroughly:** Keep detailed notes of work performed in the ticket for client transparency

## Questions?

If you're uncertain whether a request requires a support ticket or falls within plan coverage, consult with management before proceeding.
